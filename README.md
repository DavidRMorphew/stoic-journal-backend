# The Stoics Journal API

## Storing Reflections and Making Connections

This backend API is designed to retrieve and present quotations from ancient Stoic authors at random for the user to reflect upon and write responses to in their own personal journal.

## Future Endeavors
I still love Ancient Greek and Latin (so much so that I have several degrees in it!). When I have more time, I hope to start translating these texts on my own, adding more organization to the topics discussed.
